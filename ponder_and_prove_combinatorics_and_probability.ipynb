    "#### Fun?\n",
    "   I enjoyed the probability questions and coding, especially the one about Caesar's breath, but, honestly, I thought running the program for 24 hours didn't have a purpose. Most of us students only have one computer, and we have other classes and things to do. Putting all other homework and work on hold so that our computer can run a program for 24 hours is not exactly realistic. My computer crashed when running it, and my husband's seemed close to overheating/crashing if other activities were done while it was running.\n",
    "   I find it extremely unlikely that this scenario actually happens in the real world. Most companies will allot enough resources for such programs to run but not interfere with other work. I did not see the point to this assignment, sorry. \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### New?\n",
    "   Well, I learned that I might be breathing a lot of molecules of very famous people! If you think of how many breaths we take in a lifetime, and then do this probability math, it is very, very likely (if not completely guaranteed) that you're breathing what a very famous person breathed out!\n",
    "   To be a little more serious, I learned how to apply math to the real world. I learned how to call a function with a loop and use an interrupt to end an infinite loop while saving the output. I learned just how huge factorials can be. I thought my conjecture would be able to verify up to a much higher number. It only went to a little over 50,000!\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Meaningful? Build upon? Connections?\n",
    "   I am sure that I will be building upon the use of probability in real-world problems. My husband and I really like card games, and so it has been fun to estimate the probability of getting a certain card or certain color. We spent an hour on one collaborative board game, and we were one turn away from winning. Sadly, we only had a 43% chance of not picking up a card that would kill us. We picked up a card that would kill us, and lost the game. I wonder how we could use this kind of math to increase the probability of winning. Probability is fascinating!\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Collaborators?\n",
    "   I worked with Daniel Strickland and Bretton Steiner. Bretton found the count_num_twos() function on geekforgeeks.org. He adapted it to work for our program.\n",
    "   Bretton also clarified the Caesar's breath problem. I thought it was just one_breath / all_air, but he helped us realize the need to use the multiplication. Daniel found the source. (I had previously read that source, but Daniel brought it back to my attention.)"
