(https://www.futilitycloset.com/2010/06/27/conways-prime-producing-machine/) It uses the two lists as fractions (flibber numbers are numerators, flobber numbers are denominators). We use our $i$ and find the first \"fraction\" that generates a whole number, then use that as the new $i$. When our $i$ is big enough (2 raised to a prime) we print it out.\n",

Over time the program's efficiency will decrease and possibly even cause the system to crash. This function can find an infinity of primes, but it is undecidable if it will find all primes.\n"
