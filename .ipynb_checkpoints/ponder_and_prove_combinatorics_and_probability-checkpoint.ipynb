    "## #1 Conjecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A number-theoretic conjecture of combinatorial significance is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$degree2({2n \\choose n}) =$ the \"bits-on count\" (or population count, or Hamming weight) of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$degree2(m)$ is defined as the number (degree, exponent) of 2's in the prime factorization of $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for any $m$, a positive integer, $m = 2^e \\cdot o$ where $o$ is an odd positive integer (could be 1) and $e$ is a natural number, including zero --- which would be the case when $m$ is odd. It's the $e$ that is the $degree2$ of $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to state this conjecture is that the number of 1's in the binary expansion of $n$ for positive integer $n$ is equal to the number of 2's in the prime factorization of ${2n \\choose n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write Python code to test this conjecture for as many positive integers as you can. See the self-assessment for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: a `bitsoncount` function can be a one-liner in Python: `return bin(x).count('1')`\n",

    "A dark room contains two barrels. The first barrel is filled with green marbles, the second is filled with a half-and-half mixture of green and blue marbles. So there's a 100% chance of choosing a green marble from the first barrel, and a 50% chance of choosing either color in the second barrel. You reach into one of the barrels (it's dark so you don't know which one) and select a marble at random. It's green. You select another. It's green too. You select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time. What is the *minimum* number of marbles you need to select to *exceed* a probability of 99% that you are picking them out of the all-green barrel? (Note that there are enough marbles so that the answer does not depend on how many marbles are in the second barrel.)\n"
